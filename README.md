# Super Trunfo Game Project

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic card game Super Trunfo (also known as Top Trumps ) in C++.
It was created as part of my learning journey to 
deepen my understanding of C++ programming, file handling, 
and object-oriented concepts. The project consists of two separate programs:
#### 1. Card Generator : A program to manage the deck of cards (add, import, edit, delete, and list cards).
#### 2. Game : A program that uses the generated cards to simulate a match between two players.
The theme of the game can be customized (e.g., sports, cars, airplanes, etc.), but the default example provided here is based on soccer players.
## Features

### 1. Card Generator

The Card Generator allows users to create and manage a deck of cards. Each card has attributes (e.g., name, age, games played, goals scored, titles won, salary). 
The program provides the following functionalities:
- #### Add Cards : Manually input card details.
- #### Import Cards : Import cards from a text file where each line represents a card with attributes separated by spaces.
- #### Edit Cards : Update the attributes of an existing card.
- #### Delete Cards : Remove a card from the deck.
- #### List Cards : Display all cards in the deck.

 The cards are temporarily stored in a static array during runtime and saved to a binary file (baralho.dat)
when the program exits. The binary file contains:

- A header: "BARALHO" (56 bits).
- A count of the number of cards (16 bits).
- The card data.
### 2. Game 
The Game program simulates a match between two players using the cards generated by the Card Generator . Key features include:
- #### Random Card Selection : Each player receives 4 random cards from the deck.
- #### Turn-Based Gameplay : Players take turns choosing attributes to compete.
- #### Scoring System :
  - Win: 2 points.
  -  Tie: 1 point.
- #### Match Duration : The game lasts for 4 rounds, after which the player with the most points wins.
The game reads the deck of cards from the binary file (baralho.dat) into a dynamic array at startup. The file
is not modified during gameplay.

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC).
- Visual Studio or any IDE that supports C++ development.
- Basic knowledge of C++ and file handling.
  ### Steps
1.  Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/vinytacana/SuperTrunfo.git
     cd super-trunfo
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio:
   - The solution contains two projects: Card Generator and Game .
   - Set the desired project as the startup project.
3. Run the Card Generator :
     - Use the menu to add, import, edit, delete, or list cards.
     - Ensure you save the changes before exiting.
4. Run the Game :
     - Start a new match and enjoy the gameplay!

## Learning Goals
This project was created as part of my journey to learn more about:
- C++ Programming : Working with arrays, pointers, and file handling.
- Binary File Management : Reading and writing structured data to binary files.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation : Using dynamic arrays to handle variable-sized data.
- Modular Design : Separating functionality into distinct programs (Card Generator and Game).
## Contribution
I welcome contributions and improvements to the code! If you have ideas for enhancements, bug fixes, or new features, feel free to 
open an issue or submit a pull request. Some potential areas for improvement include:
- Adding more themes for the cards (e.g., cars, airplanes).
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Enhancing the game logic to support more players or additional rules.
- Optimizing file handling and memory management.
